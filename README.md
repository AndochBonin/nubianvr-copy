## Built with nextjs, typescript, chakraui, and bootstrapped with a previous project of mine.

### To Run:
- Download source code and navigate to the folder in your code editor.
- Run "npm i" and "npm run dev"

### Potential Issues:
- Vscode Typescript types - if using vscode there may be a typescript conflict, in this case in workspace settings make sure typescript version is selected as "project version" instead of "vscode version"

### Approach:
- Chakra UI for UI
- Used client side data fetching as opposed to server side (getStaticProps, getServerSideProps) in order to display initial UI while showing loading state as API call is made.

### Challenges:
- UI animation
